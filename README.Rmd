## Summary

Write-up of your project and findings go here. 
Think of this as the text of your presentation. 
The length should be roughly 5 minutes when read out loud.
Although pacing varies, a 5-minute speech is roughly 750 words. 
To use the word count addin, select the text you want to count the words of (probably this is the 
Summary section of this document, go to Addins, and select the `Word count` addin).
This addin counts words using two different algorithms, but the results should be similar and as long as you're in the ballpark of 750 words, you're good! 
The addin will ignore code chunks and only count the words in prose.

You can also load your data here and present any analysis results / plots, but I strongly urge you to keep that to a minimum (maybe only the most important graphic, if you have one you can choose). 
And make sure to hide your code with  `echo = FALSE` unless the point you are trying to make is about the code itself.
Your results with proper output and graphics go in your presentation, this space is for a brief summary of your project.

All of our graphs were made in the mdrgraphs document (/project/analysis/mdrgraphs.md). 

In our Scatterplot of Mount Desert Rock mid tide temperatures in degrees Celsius. Temperatures are shown across a date range from 2017 to 2022. The temperatures range from negative 10 to positive 30 degrees Celsius and fluctuate throughout the year. Colder temperatures occur in the winter and warmer temperatures occur in the summer months. Temperature is an important factor in the intertidal because it helps determine the distribution of different species. Organisms found in the high intertidal need to be the most adapted to changes in temperature. Water temperatures stay relatively constant, but changes in air temperature can greatly impact the interidal. Some species, like crabs, will migrate into the lower intertidal and subtitle regions during the winter to avoid colder temperatures. And, on the west coast a few years ago, there was a heat dome that killed off many intertidal organisms who were exposed to heat for too long. However, we found that there was not a great enough variation of temperature over the years to change the species composition.

Snail populations are increasing.

The seaweed cover for the species we looked are decreasing.


In terms of limitations, there was a lack of standardization in data collection as it was collected by different people each year. There could have also been some misidentification as the data was collected by students who were only trained a week prior to collection, this led to a baseline of human error. In some cases, the identification did not make sense. For example, Ulva, a low intertidal seaweed species, was listed in the high intertidal. To resolve this, we had to remove all observations of Ulva in the high intertidal. Additionally, some species are really hard to identify, for example, we had to group all the fucuses together since it is almost impossible to tell them apart without DNA identification due to factors like phenotypic plasticity. Another limitation was that there are missing years.Because of unclear data entry, we had to omit all the survey data from 2018. We omitted 2017 in the snail plot, because periwinkle snails were not identified to species. We also werenâ€™t able to get temperature data from 2023.

In the future, it is important to continue monitoring temperature changes to see if this impacts species composition in a changing climate. It would also be helpful to conduct an experiment to see if the herbivorous snails are causing the decline in seaweed. In terms of data analysis, we would like to look at the vertical transects to visualize species composition from the high to low intertidal. Furthermore, it would be interesting to visualize species composition for other invertebrates as we only looked at snails.
